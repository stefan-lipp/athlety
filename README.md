## Features

Athley currently supports the following functionality:

## Getting Started

The project setup assumes that there exists an _AppConfig.plist_ file within the _Athlety_ directory, 
which includes the base URL and an API key for the public LADV API. 
An _AppConfig.sample.plist_ file serves as a reference for this and can be copied or renamed accordingly. 
Make sure that you don't forget to enter your own LADV API key in the final _AppConfig.plist_ file.
