# Athlety

Athlety is an iOS application for track & field athletes and coaches in Germany.

## Getting Started

The project setup assumes that there exists an _AppConfig.plist_ file within the _Athlety_ directory, 
which includes the base URL and an API key for the public LADV API. 
An _AppConfig.sample.plist_ file serves as a reference for this and can be copied or renamed accordingly. 
Make sure that you don't forget to enter your own LADV API key in the final _AppConfig.plist_ file.

## Features

Athley currently supports the following functionality:
* Get an overview about upcoming track & field events in Germany
* Filter upcoming events by state association
* View documents like the official announcement or schedule for events
* Save events for quick access as bookmarks on device
* Synchronize saved events between devices via iCloud
